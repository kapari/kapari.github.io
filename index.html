                                                The current version of DanceMatch is the MVP for a dance partner matching application.
                                                Built with Python and Django on the back end, and Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3
                                                (such as it is) on the front end. I was definitely focused on learning Django and Javascript
                                                in this project.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                I got the idea for this project from when I took an online HCI class from Stanford.
                                                I did some need-finding interviews with people from the local dance community early in
                                                the class, and found that many dancers wanted to practice during the week but had
                                                no one to practice with. They would take weekly classes or private lessons, and
                                                felt like they weren't progressing as well as they would with additional reinforcement
                                                between lessons. The hard part was finding someone to practice with, especially in
                                                their area, as many dancers drive a fair distance to dance in Portland.

                                            <h3>Status</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                The current version of the app gives you a way to specify which dances you do and
                                                what you're working on for each, so that others may find you based on shared goals.
                                                It also lets you choose locations you are willing to travel to, so that you'll know
                                                right away if meeting with someone would be feasible for both of you. You're able
                                                to search for others based on dance and role, with an optional goal if you're specifically
                                                looking for a competition or routine partner.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The next steps for this project would be cleaning up the current funtionality: be able to view others'
                                                profiles, and automatically filter search results based on overlapping preferred
                                                locations. I'd also like to filter out the "Inactive" results, so people can leave
                                                their information up but not have it show up in searches if they're not working on
                                                it at the moment.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Most of the app is a SPA, but I'd like to get the Image Upload and New Dance forms
                                                combined as well; they are currently separate pages, so all of the data has to load again
                                                once you submit. I'd also like to let people log out.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In the future, I'd like to implement additional functionality: a simple messaging
                                                system to mask email addresses, and helping people find buddies to attend dances through
                                                a Preferred Venue model. I've heard from a number of people that it can be daunting
                                                going somewhere and not knowing anyone, and some dancers want someone (like a gym buddy) to
                                                keep them from backing out at the last minute.
                                            </p>

                                            <h4>Waiting to Load</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                I wrapped the JavaScript in an <code>init</code> function so it would wait until the DOM had
                                                finished loading, but since most of the site is drawn based on what comes in from the database,
                                                I ended up with a race condition. <code>setTimeout</code> kept my selects
                                                from drawing before they had the data to fill in their options.
                                            </p>
                                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/kapari/ebc8ba7caffae6b9caa8.js"></script>
                                            <h4>Dynamically Drawing Dropdowns</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                I had a lot of many-to-many models to fill in my Dance Preferences: Dance, Dance Role,
                                                Skill Level, Goal, and Activity (if you're working on this dance right now or not). In this
                                                example, I'm drawing the selects in a form for the user to edit a particular Dance
                                                Preference. To fill in each option, I saved the model data in a <code>DM</code> namespace
                                                and passed each one separately into the <code>drawDropdown</code> function. To further
                                                abstract things, I also saved a list of the models I wanted to call in <code>
                                                DM.model_list</code>, so I loop through each of those in <code>drawPrefEdit</code>.
                                            </p>
                                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/kapari/10cbe336829ae4183f03.js"></script>
                                            <p>
                                                For each item, I create an option and fill it with the <code>name</code> of the item,
                                                and then set the <code>value</code> to be the item's <code>id</code>, for later retrieval. I've passed in the current value to the <code>drawDropdown</code>
                                                so it shows up already selected. I then add the item to the parent <code>select</code> that
                                                has been passed in.
                                            </p>
                                            <h4>Sorting and Filtering</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                I wanted to use the built-in <code>.sort()</code> function in JavaScript, but it
                                                didn't allow any parameters to be passed in. I found the idea
                                                online and was unreasonably excited about it: call a function <strong>with</strong> parameters
                                                that returns a function <strong>without</strong> parameters for the <code>
                                                .sort()</code> to deal with.
                                            </p>
                                            <script src="https://gist.github.com/kapari/ff95a2134db05fa257ef.js"></script>
                                            <p>
                                                The two things I was sorting by were the person's Name and their Skill Level. Name
                                                sorts fine alphabetically, but I had to specify to sort by the the Skill Level's <code>
                                                id</code>. <code>is_ascending</code> is based on a CSS class that is added and removed
                                                when the column header is clicked.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                When all the data has been sorted and filtered, the results table is redrawn.
                                            </p>
                                            <h4>AJAX Create &amp; Delete</h4>

                                                An event listener calls <code>onSuburbUpdate</code> whenever a Suburb checkbox is
                                                checked or unchecked, and it sends a JSON update to the view <code>update_suburb</code>.
                                                This allows the user to quickly add or remove a Suburb from
                                                their list without having to reload the page.
                                            </p>

                                                <code>onSuburbUpdate</code> toggles the class "checked" in the CSS class list, in
                                                response to the user input. Then it builds a JSON update to send to <code>update_suburb</code>.
                                                If the Suburb is checked, the <code>action</code> will be "SAVE" and it will create a
                                                new instance of the PreferredSuburb many-to-many model. If unchecked, the <code>action</code>
                                                will be "DELETE" and will remove the existing instance.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <code>update_suburb</code> gets the User from the <code>user_id</code>, the Dancer from the User (a one-to-one
                                                relationship), and the Suburb from the <code>sub_id</code>, using <code>.filter()</code>
                                                so as to not throw a 404 error if the PreferredSuburb isn't there.

                                                The app is currently deployed on a AWS Ubuntu server running Apache. I learned more about SSH
                                                keys and Linux commands, like how to change permissions, check the <code>error.log</code> file in VI in the
                                                terminal, and create aliasing for commands in <code>.bash_profile</code>. There was a fair amount of
                                                troubleshooting to set the paths in the <code>.conf</code> file to <code>wsgi.py</code>.

                                <p>I've been teaching group classes and private lessons for nearly four years, currently out of

                                    Uptown, I co-founded and hosted a twice-monthly social dance for about two years, and taught group
                                    classes at various places around Portland.</p>

                                <p>My favorite dances are Nightclub Two-Step, West Coast Swing, Cross-Step Waltz, and Hustle.
                                    I also do a smattering of other dances.</p>

                                <p>Although I don't do it too often these days, my first love was drawing. I spent some time
                                    as a pet portrait artist, enjoying the delicacy and precision of portraiture combined
                                    with cute animals. 'Cause cute animals.</p>

                                <p>I like to take an unreasonable number of photos with my Nikon D3000 whenever I go
                                    somewhere pretty.</p>
